# TopicsNetworksPyladies

A very simple talk for Boston PyLadies (March 2015) on using the [topic modeling toolkit GUI](https://code.google.com/p/topic-modeling-tool/) on a directory of fiction chapters, post-processing the CSV output in Python, and creating a network to view in Gephi.

See the main code/talk [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/arnicas/TopicsNetworksPyladies/blob/master/SimpleTopic%20Analysis%20and%20Networks.ipynb).
