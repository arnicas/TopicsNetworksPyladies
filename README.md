# TopicsNetworksPyladies

A very simple talk with lots of demo for Boston PyLadies (March 2015), updated slightly in Oct 2015 for the UMiami CCS talk, on using the [topic modeling toolkit GUI](https://code.google.com/p/topic-modeling-tool/) on a directory of fiction chapters, post-processing the CSV output in Python, and creating a network to view in Gephi. Also added notes on reating the sigma.js website export from Gephi at the end.
